This project will be a test of my ability to use object oriented principles within a web development scope; I'll be utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap to complete it.  

This will also be the first project where I feel comfortable enough to jump in despite not having done all the readings/exercises.  I'll dive headfirst into this project and learn the relevant topics along the way.
